- we are using the `ClamAV` open source data set of virus signatures
  - https://database.clamav.net/main.cvd
  - after we downloaded the dataset, you need to extract it out into its individual pieces with the following terminal command
    ```
    dd if=main.cvd of=clamav_main.tar.gz skip=1 bs=512
    tar zxvf clamav_main.tar.gz
    chmod 700 *
    ```
- This will output a bunch of files. The one we're interested in is `main.hdb`.
- `ClamAV` uses two hashing algorithms for the virus signatures. One is `md5` and the other is `sha 1`. The `md5` is 32 characters long and the `sha 1` is 40 characters.
